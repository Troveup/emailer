# emailer
Dumb mass e-mail Java application for quickly sending out e-mails from a Troveup account.

All instructions came from here:
https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/java

Components that have been omitted for security:

1. API JSON private key for API access to Gmail (see Step 1 on Quickstart)
2. Full list of users.  A sample csv has been provided.
